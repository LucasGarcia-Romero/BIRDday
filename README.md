BirdDeep is an autonomous recording platform built on Orange Pi, designed to capture environmental audio using AudioMoth and collect climate data (temperature and humidity) with a DHT22 sensor.  The system is intended for bioacoustics research, environmental monitoring, and citizen science projects.
